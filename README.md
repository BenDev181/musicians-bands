# Musicians and Bands Database
Rock on, dude! We're going to build Band/Musician organizer.

**GOAL**: Weâ€™ll be creating a database that contains 3 models:
- `Musician`
- `Band`
- `Song`

We will be working on this across multiple days. **The work on this repository will be split across two days**

## Day 1: Database Creation

### Installing Dependencies and Running Tests
1. Once the forked repository has been cloned, make sure to run:
```shell
npm install
```

2. Additionally, youâ€™ll need to create the following file in the root of the project: `db.sqlite`. This database file is considered sensitive in nature, so it will not be pushed up to a repository when the project is pushed.
3. To run the tests, run `npm test`. The test file is created, but each test is currently empty. Initially, youâ€™ll get many errors and messages like `Test suite failed to run since there are missing parts`.

### `Band`, `Musician`, `Song`, and Tests
> Code in all the spots where it says TODO in the project (you can [search across files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-across-files) to find the spots to edit!). Below are the instructions:

1. In `db.js`, create a new sequelize connection.
2. In `/models/Band.js`, define a `Band` model. The `Band` model should have the following properties:
    - `name`: a string
    - `genre`: a string
3. In `/models/Musician.js`, define a `Musician` model. The `Musician` model should have the following properties:
    - `name`: a string
    - `instrument`: a string
4. In `/models/Song.j`s, define a `Song` model. The `Song` model should have the following properties:
    - `title`: a string
    - `year`: a number
    - `length`: a number
5. Now that we have our models defined, it is time to create some tests in `index.test.js` to verify that our models function as intended. Create tests that do the following:
    - Can create a new `Band`
    - Can create a new `Musician`
    - Can create a new `Song`
    - Can update a `Band` instance
    - Can update a `Musician` instance
    - Can update a `Song` instance
    - Can delete a `Band` instance
    - Can delete a `Musician` instance
    - Can delete a `Song` instance

> When testing your code you will need to first create and band, musician, or song and then verify that it has been added. For example, a test with a User database, may look something like:
> ```javascript
> test('can create a Band', async () => {
>    const testUser = await User.create({ name: 'George', password: '123' });
>    expect(testUser.name).toBe('George');
>}
>```

### Extensions ðŸš€

1. Add a `showCount` property to the `Band` model (number) and account for the new column in the tests.
2. Implement data seeding to populate the `Band`, `Musician`, and `Song` models with initial data using `bulkCreate()`. 
3. Research the provided [increment and decrement methods](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-instances/#incrementing-and-decrementing-integer-values). Create tests to verify that you can increment and decrement
4. [Research how to create instance methods with Sequelize](https://sebhastian.com/sequelize-instance-methods/). Create some instance methods and tests to verify that they work as intended. A few instance methods to consider:
    - A `toString()` method that converts the data stored into a simple string like Band: Queen Genre: Rock. 
    - A `toMinutes()` method for the Song model that takes the duration in seconds and returns the number of minutes.
    - A `getLongestSong()` model for the Song model that returns the song with the longest duration.

## Day 2: Associations

### One-to-Many Associations

1. In the `index.js` file, before the `module.exports`, associate the `Band` and `Musician` models. 
    - **Multiple musicians can be added to a band.**
    - **Every musician has only one band.**
2. In `index.test.js`, create a test to account for this association. In the test:
    - Use `Band.findAll()` to get the bands (if there arenâ€™t any from the previous tests, youâ€™ll have to `Band.create()` some!)
    - For each of the bands, use something like `foundBand.getMusicians()` to check that they have been added correctly!
3. Run `npm test` to verify the test runs properly.

### Many-to-Many Associations
1. In the `./index.js` file, before the `module.exports`, associate the `Song` and `Band` models.
    - Multiple songs can be added to a Band.
    - Multiple bands can have the same Song.
2. In `index.test.js`, add another test to account for the `Song` and `Musician` association.
3. Run `npm test`
4. Write a test to add multiple musicians to a band. In the test:
    - `Band.create()` to make some bands. Use the data youâ€™ve added in previous tests youâ€™ve created!
    - Create at least 2 songs
    - For one band, add both songs
    - For each of the songs, use something like `foundBand.getSongs()` to check that they have been added correctly!
    - Do the same with the bands.

## Extensions ðŸš€

### `Manager` 
1. Create a new model called `Manager` that will represent the person managing a `Band` has made. `Manager` can have properties of your choice, but a few you may want to add:
    - `name`: a string
    - `email`: a string
    - `salary`: a number
    - `dateHired`: a date
2. In the `./index.js` file, before the `module.exports`, associate the two models.
    - A single `Band` can be added to a `Manager`
    - A single `Manager` can be added to a `Band`.
3. Write a test to add a manager to a band and test the association.

### Eager Loading
1. Run `npm test`
2. Create test data and associate the models as in previous tests.
3. Find all the Bands
4. In the `Band.findAll()` call, include the `Musician` model.
5. Do the same again, but this time include the `Song` model.
6. Test the output
